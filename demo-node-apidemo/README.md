# Description 

This demonstration shows how to interact with the API from a NodeJS web application on the Apcera Platform.

# How to run - Apcera

$CLUSTER should be the address of the API server. The $username and $password variables are for you to set the credentials for the web interface.
 

```
cd demo-node-apidemo
apc app create node-apidemo-app --stager /apcera::nodejs -ae --batch 
apc app update node-apidemo-app  -e username="*" -e password="*" -e CLUSTER="$CLUSTER" --restart --batch
apc app start node-apidemo-app 
```

Navigate to the URL provided from the app staging process to view the output page.


# How to run - Docker

```
cd demo-node-apidemo
```

Edit "Dockerfile" and replace "myToken" with the Bearer token and api.cluster.net with the correct address. Finally, modify the username and password entries for the web interface.

Save and exit the file and build a container:
```
docker build -t apidemo .
```
Run the container:
```
docker run -d --net=host apidemo
```
Connect to the web interface on port 8080.
